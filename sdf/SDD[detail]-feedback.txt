Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
This is good work, Jenna.  I like the way you have parsimoniously described
the parts.  The diagrams show how they interact well, and the database
design is pretty clear.  You've jumped ahead a little, since you only need
the architecture level sections for this deliverable, but it never hurts to
get a jump on the next deliverable, right?

One thing to fix is the "shall" language.  That kind of statement belongs
in the requirements document, not in the design document.  Also, try to use
present tense in your descriptions throughout.  You have some present and
some future, which makes the readers [e.g. the developers] think you haven't
settled on the design yet.

For your detailed design, you should consider changing the database diagram
to an actual Entity-Relationship Diagram.  I can help you with that if you
like, or I'm sure Dondi can help you put that together.

All in all, nice work!  Make the changes indicated above by the end of the
semester for full credit on this deliverable.

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Good job on the detailed design, Jenna!

One thing I would suggest is that when providing the details of each class,
break the list of fields and methods up differently so that the reader is
able to see distinctly what each part contains.  For example, you could
make the parts into a bullet list:

6.3.1.3 Express Server Class ~ This class runs the GraphQL server.app
   + Express server root: provides resolver function for each API endpoint
   + schema: provide GraphQL API schema

....and so forth.  Running it all together without any punctuation or any
delimiters makes it confusing to the reader.

Other than that, looks pretty complete!  Nice job.

Evaluation score:

    15% out of 15% for this deliverable:  A-plus
         Note that the "CDR presentation is folded into "ABCDR"
            so the 15% reflects 10% for detail and 5% for CDR
