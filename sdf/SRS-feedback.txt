=====================================================================================
Very nice work on this deliverable!  Just a couple of things to add on for the
second submission by semester's end.

The schedule in your SDP still says "(graphic in progress)".  Needs to be
completed.

No diagram of the system in the SRS.  Needs to be completed.

CSCI breakdown is good!  You have a lot of parts, which shows you have put
plenty of thought into this project.

Be careful with requirements like 5.3.1.3 ~ if you say "6 web pages" that may
get taken to mean you can display ANY 6 web pages.  A "will" statement could
help elucidate what six pages you mean.

Generally, try to be more specific about the requirements. Use the sections
from the CSCI breakdown as headers to each section of functional requirements
so that they align.  You have the CSC's in there, but not the CSU's.

Be careful of the word "and" which usually means you need to split that
statement into at least two requirements.

Otherwise, nice work!  Excellent job on the breakdown, Jenna!

Make those document organization changes and maybe add a few requirements to
the functional section by the end of the semester and you'll have full credit
for this portino of the project!
