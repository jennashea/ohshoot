### Pilone & Miles Book Assignment
By Jenna Berlinberg

##### Problem 1
Write a short paragraph to answer these three questions:

What are the two major concerns of any software project?
Which do you feel is more important?
Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?

The two major concerns of any software project is the cost of the project and the time it will take to finish it. Often, the more time needed, the more cost it will bring to the customer. However, the developers need enough time to implement all of the functionality the customer requests. I would consider the time to be most important, because I have a lot of concerns personally with overworking. Not giving enough time often results in lesser quality product or an unfinished one. If the cost and time estimates end up being too much for the customer to handle, this usually means they should simplify their requirements.

##### Problem 2
In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.

The four main phases are requirements, design, code, and test. I prefer having a temporary set of overall requirements and design that is then broken down within the iterations. In between each iteration, the requirements and design will be revisited and updated with any of the changes made with the code checks.

##### Problem 3
In the Waterfall method for software development, what are the main phases that occur? How are they different from the phases in the Agile method? What other phases are in Waterfall that are left out of Agile? Do you think these are needed in Waterfall? Describe a situation using Agile in which one of these extra Waterfall phases might me needed.

The main phases are requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The iterations in Agile each contain bite-size and targeted pieces of the first four, while Waterfall prefers the whole shebang be done. This makes adapting changes that the  customer inevitably will request a lengthy process. Maintenance might still be needed in an Agile method, but it would be require less significant changes and thus take less time. However, this sort of approach might be imperative when firm documentation is required, such as in high-risk industries involving government contracts.

##### Problem 4
Write one-sentence answers to the following questions:

- What is a user story?
A user story is a requirement stated in the lens of the client using the software.

- What is blueskying?
Blueskying is meeting with all people involved in the project, including the customer, where they throw out ideas for the project without any restrictions on their thought processes. Sky's the limit!

- What are four things that user stories SHOULD do?
A user story should describe one function the customer requests of the software, be written in a way that makes sense to the customer, be written by the customer, and be short- no more than 3 sentences.

- What are three things that user stories SHOULD NOT do?
User stories should not be a long essay, use technical terms that would confuse the customer, or mention specific technologies.

##### Problem 5

What is your opinion on the following statements, and why do you feel that way:

> All assumptions are bad, and no assumption is a good assumption.
There's a related idiom- "Assumptions make an ass of you and me." Assumptions not only make you feel dumb or might make you place blame on the customer for not being specific enough, the customer also might feel dumb for not communicating their goals clearly or place blame on you for not reading their mind or asking for clarification. It is always better to try to clear things up to avoid this sort of issue.

> A big user story estimate is a bad user story estimate.
This seems to be a good way to check yourself on whether or not your user story is too broad. The book specifies >15 days as too much, but others believe even 7 days is a sign that you should break down the user story more. It also provides room for a sanity check with the customer, which might reveal crucial assumptions  

##### Problem 6
Fill in the blanks in the statements below, using the following things [you can use each thing for more than one statement]: Blueskying; Role playing; Observation; User story; Estimate; Planning poker.

- You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: User Story
- The more of me there are, the clearer things become: User Story
- I help you capture EVERYTHING: Blueskying
- I help you get more from the customer: Role playing
- In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: Observation
- Some people say I'm arrogant, but really I'm just about confidence: Estimate
- Everyone's involved when it comes to me: Blueskying

##### Problem 7
Explain what is meant by a better than best-case estimate.
A programmer would give you an estimate with assumption of perfect conditions- they can work straight with no interruptions, will make no mistakes as they go, testing isn't their problem, etc. This does not take into account the real life requirements that come from working in a team, taking care of issues that don't involve work, and more. This estimate is way too short for reality and you'd give the customer an incorrect assumption of software development.

##### Problem 8
In your opinion, when would be the best time to tell your customer that you will NOT be able to meet her delivery schedule? Why do you feel that is the best time? Do you think that would be a difficult conversation?
I would do it as soon as possible once the estimate has been confidently calculated and you can effectively communicate the thought process between the calculations. This way, little time is lost and the plan can be reworked with the input of the customer. Your team might have recommended they put off one user story that they would prefer over one you had kept in the schedule, so getting that input would be valuable. It would be a difficult conversation since most humans hate letting people down, and the customer is in a position where their satisfaction is imperative to your job security.

##### Problem 9
Discuss why you think branching in your software configuration is bad or good. Describe a scenario to support your opinion.
Branching is an extremely helpful tool in significant group projects where asynchronous work on multiple different files is needed. It can be tedious and hard to adjust to when you first encounter it, but it's a lifesaver in massive projects. It might be not worth the time configuring it for smaller projects (both people and code) that are mostly done synchronously or completely separate. A freshman year intro class group project where the group has split the work out in fourths and are all in separate files might not need four different branches. 


##### Problem 10
Have you used a build tool in your development? Which tool have you used? What are its good points? What are it's bad points?
