### Pilone & Miles Book Assignment
By Jenna Berlinberg

##### Problem 1
Write a short paragraph to answer these three questions:

What are the two major concerns of any software project?
Which do you feel is more important?
Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?

The two major concerns of any software project is the cost of the project and the time it will take to finish it. Often, the more time needed, the more cost it will bring to the customer. However, the developers need enough time to implement all of the functionality the customer requests. I would consider the time to be most important, because I have a lot of concerns personally with overworking. Not giving enough time often results in lesser quality product or an unfinished one. If the cost and time estimates end up being too much for the customer to handle, this usually means they should simplify their requirements.

##### Problem 2
In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.

##### Problem 3
In the Waterfall method for software development, what are the main phases that occur? How are they different from the phases in the Agile method? What other phases are in Waterfall that are left out of Agile? Do you think these are needed in Waterfall? Describe a situation using Agile in which one of these extra Waterfall phases might me needed.
