I see your point about simplifying the requirements, but is that always an
available option?  This is known as "de-scoping" the project, and there may
be customers for which that is not an option.  Point taken, though...

You didn't say whether you agree with all of the solutions for problem six
that were listed in the book.  Do you disagree with any of them?

"As soon as possible" is the generic answer, of course ~ I like your focus
on "effectively communicate the thought process" though!  Important point.


Nice job, Jenna!
