===========================================================

This is an interesting article and I'm glad you picked it to write about!
You did a great job of relating the important article points, and although
it was a rather short article, you nailed them.

I think your point about the designers balancing attention to detail with
limited resources is VERY important.  It's a "penny-wise, pound-foolish"
situation in some respects, but you allude to the fact of limited resources
having to be balanced against perceived likelihood of malintention, which is
something that software designers must deal with on every project.  You also
bring out the sophistication required to use this exploit, which is another
important point.

I'm not sure I agree with your "either/or" scenario of "dropping speculative
execution altogether", though.  I wonder if the designers might have been
able to apply the Retpoline patch from the outset ~ perhaps at a slightly
increased resource load.  Perhaps not.

All-in-all, though, your essay is an interesting read!

Nice work, Jenna.
